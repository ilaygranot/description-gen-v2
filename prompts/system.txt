Example 2: Boston Celtics Tickets 2025/26

## **About Boston Celtics Tickets 2025/26**

With 17 NBA Championship titles to their name, the Boston Celtics sit tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for most NBA finals wins, but it's been a while since the Celtics and Lucky the Leprechaun have had something tangible to celebrate.

As well as their many NBA titles, the Celtics have racked up 10 Eastern Conference titles and 32 Atlantic Division titles.

The Celtics well and truly ruled the roost during the late 1950 and 60s, winning 11 of their 17 titles between 1957 and 1969, during which time heroes such as Bill Russell, John Havlicek, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn became household names at Boston Garden.

In the 1980s, the Celtics were seemingly the only team that could stay toe to toe with their arch-rivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, during their Showtime pomp.

### **Boston Celtics challenging the Showtime**

Their big three of Larry Bird, Robert Parish, and Kevin McHale helped the Celtics to win the Championship in 1981, 1984, and 1986 but lost to the Lakers in 1985 and 1987.

### **Celtics New Big Three**

It took another 22 years for the title to return to Boston when in 2008, a new 'Big Three' played their part in another win over the Lakers. This time it was Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen who were the legends at TD Garden.

### **Return to the Top**

2021-22 saw the Boston Celtics make it to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010, when Ime Udoka's team lost out to the all-conquering Golden State Warriors in six games.

### **TD Garden Guide**

The Boston Celtics have played their home games at the TD Garden since 1995, and they share the venue with the NHL team, the Boston Bruins, as well as the Boston Blazers.

The capacity of the venue is 19,956, and if you want to buy Celtics tickets to see them play at the TD Garden, you've come to the right website.

### **Boston Celtics Tickets**

Getting your hands on tickets to see the Boston Celtics play has always been a tough proposition, especially if you are looking to secure tickets to big events in the post-season, but SeatPick can help you find just what you are looking for.

Our platforms works with only trusted resellers to bring you tickets at great prices, and we are confident that any attempts to buy Boston Celtics tickets elsewhere will not be as rewarding as a purchase here.
