Write an SEO-optimized description for: "{{pageName}}"

Follow the structure from the examples in the system prompt. The description should include:
1.  A two-paragraph promotional opening explaining why SeatPick is the best place to buy tickets for "{{pageName}}".
2.  Headings to structure the content, such as:
   • 'About {{pageName}}'
   • A creatively phrased *Why SeatPick* section (e.g., 'Why Choose SeatPick for {{pageName}}?' or 'What Makes SeatPick the Best Place for {{pageName}} Tickets?')
   • 'History & Key Facts' (use common-sense naming – do NOT prepend '{{pageName}}' if it already contains the word “Tickets”).
   Avoid reusing identical heading wording across different pages.
3.  Under 'History & Key Facts', include relevant subheadings (e.g., Rivalries, Famous Players, Key Moments).

- Bold the first mention of "{{pageName}}"
- Write exactly {{minWords}}-{{maxWords}} words
- Focus on the fan experience and the value SeatPick provides.
- Use Markdown for all formatting (headings, bolding, lists).
- Avoid overused slogans like "built by fans, for fans" or "designed with fans in mind"—use unique phrasing each time.
- Tailor language and references to the specific fanbase (e.g., use club lore for Arsenal supporters, song references for Taylor Swift fans) while keeping within SeatPick’s brand tone.
